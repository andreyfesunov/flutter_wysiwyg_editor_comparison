| [flutter_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill) | ❌️ Uses it's own format for storing data - Delta, so you need to adapt your code on other platforms for it (or translate from Delta to HTML/MD, which brings loses). I've used [markdown_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown_quill) to parse Quill Delta to MD, then [markdown](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown) to transform MD to HTML. ⚠️ This approach is unstable, allows for colossal losses even on simple markup, and is used for educational purposes only. | ✅️ A feature-rich WYSIWYG editor. If you are starting development with a Flutter app and don't care about the storage format, this is a great option for you.                                                                                                                                          |
| [fleather](https://pub.dev/packages/fleather)           | ❌ Uses [Parchment Delta](https://pub.dev/packages/parchment_delta) for storing data about document, so you need to adapt your code on other platforms for it (or translate from Delta to HTML/MD, which brings loses). I've used [parchment_to_html](https://pub.dev/packages/parchment_to_html) to parse document to HTML, then [html2md](https://pub.dev/packages/html2md) to transform HTML to MD.                                                                       | ✅ Simple WYSIWYG editor. If you are starting development with a Flutter app and don't care about the storage format, this is a great option for you. ⚠️ BUT take a closer look at the analogues, you may need to expand the functionality during development (in addition, it is updated very rarely). |
