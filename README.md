| [flutter_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill)               | ❌️ Uses it's own format for storing data - Delta, so you need to adapt your code on other platforms for it (or translate from Delta to HTML/MD, which brings loses). I've used [markdown_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown_quill) to parse Quill Delta to MD, then [markdown](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown) to transform MD to HTML. ⚠️ This approach is unstable, allows for colossal losses even on simple markup, and is used for educational purposes only. | ✅️ A feature-rich WYSIWYG editor. If you are starting development with a Flutter app and don't care about the storage format, this is a great option for you.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [fleather](https://pub.dev/packages/fleather)                         | ❌ Uses [Parchment Delta](https://pub.dev/packages/parchment_delta) for storing data about document, so you need to adapt your code on other platforms for it (or translate from Delta to HTML/MD, which brings loses). I've used [parchment_to_html](https://pub.dev/packages/parchment_to_html) to parse document to HTML, then [html2md](https://pub.dev/packages/html2md) to transform HTML to MD.                                                                       | ✅ Simple WYSIWYG editor. If you are starting development with a Flutter app and don't care about the storage format, this is a great option for you. ⚠️ BUT take a closer look at the analogues, you may need to expand the functionality during development (in addition, it is updated very rarely). Also Toolbar is HARDCODED, so you can't extend it. |
| [html_editor_enhanced](https://pub.dev/packages/html_editor_enhanced) | ✅️ Uses HTML as its primary format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ⚠️ Excellent editor, HOWEVER it is updated very rarely, bugs hang for YEARS, so it is NOT RECOMMENDED for use in production. However, it is an excellent basis for a fork. Also, there is no Desktop support, so it is not convenient to develop.                                                                                                         |
| [remodl_rte](https://pub.dev/packages/remodl_rte)                     | ✅️ Uses HTML as its primary format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅ Excellent editor, which is essentially a fork of [html_editor_enhanced](https://pub.dev/packages/html_editor_enhanced). It was last updated not so long ago, has more functionality, and was actually created to expand and continue the project.                                                                                                       |
